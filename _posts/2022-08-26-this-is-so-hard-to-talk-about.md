Everyone needs a will!

Get a notarized will to ensure your final wishes are honored. 

Don't let your plans go to waste and don't let the items that matter to you get stuck in limbo with the State during probate.

Most places validate wills that are signed documents, certified by a notary and witnesses. 

Check with your local and state laws to determine what is required.
