Make Your Money Work For You!

Make a plan for the next month to tell your money what you want it to do and where you want it to go. This plan is called a "budget". 

Just like how a work-order tells people what to spend their time doing on the job, a budget tells your money what to be spent on (or saved for) during the next month. 

How To Make A Budget:
Write down your expected income at the top. Then, list expected expenses in order of most important to least important or in the order that those bills are due. Subtract each expense from your expected income and you should hopefully have some money left over that you can save for any unexpected expenses. If your total is negative, then see if there is anything that you can go without or "cut" for the month.
